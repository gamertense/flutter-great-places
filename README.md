# Great Places App

A shopping app taught by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller in this [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-flutter-dart-to-build-ios-android-apps/). Some differences to the course are:

- The app is built with the latest version of Flutter (v3.3.6).
- Different padding and button style on Add New Place screen.
- Handle nullable values.
- Extract a widget in `lib/screens/places_list_screen.dart` to avoid too many nested lines of code.
